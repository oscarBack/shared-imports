# Shared Imports Monorepo Plan

A comprehensive plan for building a multi-app monorepo with Turborepo for the shared imports merchandise management platform.

## Project Architecture Overview

This monorepo will contain three main applications deployed across different platforms:
- **Landing Page**: Astro on Cloudflare Pages (static site)
